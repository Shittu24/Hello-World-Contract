A HelloWorld solidity contract using brownie framework

A constructor of the owner address so the first to deploy this contract is the owner
A number variable with a store function to store any value
A retrieve function to then return the stored value
An increment function to increase the stored value

This contract is then compiled to be sure we are doing the right thing. After successful compilation, run scripts to deploy the contract

Finally, test the contract automatically using (unit and integration tests) so the project will be up to date
